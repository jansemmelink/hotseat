# DONE

* Add/remove members to/from group

# TODO
- After create account (+acc admin user), the temp password must only be good for change password before login (at moment it works for login too, but sysadmin could have seen that password, so not safe)
- Public account + users that register themselves as member of public account - account must allow it, while other accounts require users to be created by account admin.
- User upd/del to make admin/revoke admin rights, suspend or set expiry etc...
- Delete account with all its contents (sysadmin only)
- External auth/user management for an account for list of users and login check then creaste local session
